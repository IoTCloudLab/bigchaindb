## [0.4.0] - 2016-05-27
Tag name: v0.4.0
= commit: a89399c4f9fcdf82df73e0d8191af9e539d8d081
committed: May 27, 2016, 1:42 PM GMT+2

### Added
- Support for escrow (possible because of two other new things: cryptoconditions with inverters, and a timeout condition): [Pull Request #329](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/329)
- Caching of calls to `load_consensus_plugin()`, using [`@lru_cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache). This speeds up the instantiation of `Bigchain` objects and greatly improves overall performance. [Pull Request #271](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/271)
- New `Dockerfile-dev` Docker file to make it easier for developers to _develop_ BigchainDB with Docker. One can run all unit tests with Docker again. [Pull Request #313](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/313)
- Transactions in invalid blocks are copied to the backlog: [Pull Request #221](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/221).
- Queries to the bigchain table now ignore invalid blocks: [Pull Request #324](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/324)
- Use secondary index on get_transaction: [Pull Request #324](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/324)
- New `bigchaindb` command to set the number of RethinkDB shards (in both tables): [Pull Request #258](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/258)
- Better handling of an outdated `setuptools`: [Pull Request #279](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/279)

### Changed
- The block processes now use GroupProcess: [Pull Request #267](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/267)
- Replaced the `json` Python package with `rapidjson` (a Python wrapper for a fast JSON parser/generator written in C++), to speed up JSON serialization and deserialization: [Pull Request #318](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/318)
- Overhauled `ROADMAP.md` and moved it to [the bigchaindb/org repository](https://github.com/bigchaindb/org): Pull Requests 
[#282](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/282),
[#306](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/306),
[#308](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/308),
[#325](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/325)
- AWS deployment has better support for [New Relic Server Monitoring](https://newrelic.com/server-monitoring): [Pull Request #316](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/316)
- AWS deployment script now reads from a configuration file: [Pull Request #291](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/291)
- AWS deployment script doesn't auto-start the BigchainDB servers anymore: [Pull Request #257](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/257)

### Fixed
- Bug related to transaction malleability: [Pull Request #281](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/281)

### Notes
You can now see a big-picture view of all BigchainDB repositories on [a waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/bigchaindb/org).


## [0.3.0] - 2016-05-03
Tag name: v0.3.0
= commit: a97c54e82be954a1411e5bfe0f09a9c631309f1e
committed: May 3, 2016, 11:52 AM GMT+2

### Added
- Crypto-conditions specs according to the Interledger protocol: [Pull Request #174](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/174)
- Added support for anonymous hashlocked conditions and fulfillments: [Pull Request #211](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/211)

- Several improvements to the AWS deployment scripts: [Pull Request #227](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/227)

- Bug related to block validation: [Pull Request #233](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/233)

### Notes
This release completely refactored the structure of the transactions and broke compatibility with older versions
of BigchainDB. The refactor of the transactions was made in order to add support for multiple inputs/outputs and
the crypto-conditions specs from the Interledger protocol.

We also updated the RethinkDB Python drivers so you need to upgrade to RethinkDB v2.3+

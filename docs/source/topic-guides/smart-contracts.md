# BigchainDB and Smart Contracts

BigchainDB isnâ€™t intended for running smart contracts. That said, it can do many of the things that smart contracts are used to do. For example, the owners of an asset can impose conditions that must be fulfilled by anyone wishing to transfer the asset to new owners; see the [section on conditions](models.html#conditions-and-fulfillments). BigchainDB also [supports a form of escrow](../nodes/python-server-api-examples.html#escrow).
